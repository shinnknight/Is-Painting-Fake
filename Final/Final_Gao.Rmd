Question 1. (6 points)
1a) Load the train dataset.csv and split the data into train, cross-validation and test dataframes.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
train.df = read.csv('/Users/tinggao/Documents/CU course/machine learning/Final/train_dataset.csv')
test.df = read.csv('/Users/tinggao/Documents/CU course/machine learning/Final/test_dataset.csv')
train.rows = sample(1:nrow(train.df),round(nrow(train.df) * 0.6))
test.rows = data.frame(rows=c(1:nrow(train.df)))[-train.rows,]
```

1b) Plot the scatterplot for current retail clean price vs current retail average price. Is relationship linear?
```{r}
plot(train.df$MMRCurrentRetailCleanPrice,train.df$MMRCurrentAuctionAveragePrice)
corr
```



1c) Plot distributions for the Painting age, Bids, warranty costs, acquisitions costs, etc. Which distributions are skewed?
